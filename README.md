Weather application/widget that was made using C#, MAUI, XAML, and .NET 8.0. Application uses the OpenWeather API for data, since I don't want to pay to get hourly data, the weather is displayed in intervals of 3 hours.

First UI look before functions/data mapping added:

Was a project that I wanted to use with practicing getting data from APIs, took about 3 days with minimal work.
